- The focus on this project was to how to scrape data from a webpage, create a dataset out of it, and automatically update the dataset after certain timeframe.
- The product URL was just an example for the sake of practicing; no affiliates with the seller, brand of the product or Amazon itself.
- The project was inspired and made by following directions from Alex Freberg's Youtube playlist called "Data Analytics Portfolio Project", can be watched here: https://bit.ly/3KiYuEn
